                        them in the Archives Study Area, make Bookmarks (create a list of documents in the catalogue for future reference) and see a list of documents that you've previously requested during an earlier visit. You can also request documents
                        up to two weeks in advance, reserving them for your visit and ensuring that you can make the most of your research time.
