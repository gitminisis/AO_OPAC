        <h3>History Card Registration</h3>




        <div class="text-container">
            <p>If you want to see original documents at London Metropolitan Archives you need to register for a free
                City of London History Card. Follow the link below to begin the online registration process. We
                recommend registering before you visit, but you can also complete the registration form when you arrive.
                When you arrive in our Information Area, our team will take your photograph and provide your new City of
                London History Card.</p>
            <p>While it is possible to visit us without a History Card (whether you want to use our London history
                library, watch films or browse the printed maps in our mediatheque or visit our exhibition), we highly
                recommend obtaining one. Nothing quite beats the experience of using original documents for the first
                time!</p>
        </div>


        <h3>Who can register for a History Card?</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Anyone over the age of 14 can apply for a History Card.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why do I need one?</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Everyone needs a History Card to gain access to original documents at London Metropolitan Archives. The
                History Card will also enable you to carry out your research more effectively by providing access to
                enhanced features in this catalogue. You'll be able to request original documents to view them in the
                Archives Study Area, make Bookmarks (create a list of documents in the catalogue for future reference)
                and see a list of documents that you've previously requested during an earlier visit. You can also
                request documents up to two weeks in advance, reserving them for your visit and ensuring that you can
                make the most of your research time.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How do I get one?</h3>

                below.</p>
            <p>Your details will be held on our system for 30 days before being deleted. During this time you can
                complete your registration process by bringing two proof of identity documents (one proof of identity
                and one proof of address) to the Information Area at London Metropolitan Archives where we will validate
