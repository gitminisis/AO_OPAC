                        <p>If you want to see original documents at London Metropolitan Archives you need to register for a free City of London History Card. Follow the link below to begin the online registration process. We recommend registering before
                            you visit, but you can also complete the registration form when you arrive. When you arrive in our Information Area, our team will take your photograph and provide your new City of London History Card.</p>
                        <p>While it is possible to visit us without a History Card (whether you want to use our London history library, watch films or browse the printed maps in our mediatheque or visit our exhibition), we highly recommend obtaining one.
                            Nothing quite beats the experience of using original documents for the first time!

                        <p>Everyone needs a History Card to gain access to original documents at London Metropolitan Archives. The History Card will also enable you to carry out your research more effectively by providing access to enhanced features in this
                            catalogue. You'll be able to request original documents to view them in the Archives Study Area, make Bookmarks (create a list of documents in the catalogue for future reference) and see a list of documents that you've previously
                            requested during an earlier visit. You can also request documents up to two weeks in advance, reserving them for your visit and ensuring that you can make the most of your research time.</p>
