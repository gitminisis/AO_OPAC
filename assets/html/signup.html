                If you want to see original documents at London Metropolitan
                Archives you need to register for a free City of London History
                Card. Follow the link below to begin the online registration
                process. We recommend registering before you visit, but you can
                also complete the registration form when you arrive. When you
                arrive in our Information Area, our team will take your
                photograph and provide your new City of London History Card.
              </p>

                While it is possible to visit us without a History Card (whether
                you want to use our London history library, watch films or
                browse the printed maps in our mediatheque or visit our
                exhibition), we highly recommend obtaining one. Nothing quite
                beats the experience of using original documents for the first
                time!

                Everyone needs a History Card to gain access to original
                documents at London Metropolitan Archives. The History Card will
                also enable you to carry out your research more effectively by
                providing access to enhanced features in this catalogue. You'll
                be able to request original documents to view them in the
                Archives Study Area, make Bookmarks (create a list of documents
                in the catalogue for future reference) and see a list of
                documents that you've previously requested during an earlier
                visit. You can also request documents up to two weeks in
                advance, reserving them for your visit and ensuring that you can
                make the most of your research time.

                process by bringing two proof of identity documents (one proof
                of identity and one proof of address) to the Information Area at

                application and take a photograph of you for the card and our
                record.
